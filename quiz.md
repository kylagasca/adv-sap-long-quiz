## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
- It is a method of software design that arranges programs as a group of stand-alone services and allows for flexibility in the software department.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
- There are nine characteristics of SOA which are the standard service contracts, Loose Coupling, Abstraction, Service Reusability, autonomy, statelessness, discoverability, composability, and interoperability. SOA is independent of to each other so user can developed and update services without affecting the other. 

3. Define Microservices.
- A microservice is designed to carry out a particular business function that may be implemented in a service. It also encourages flexibility in software development as many teams may work on various tasks in various services at the same time, making it simpler and quicker to create new functionality. 

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
- The main benefit of using Microservices, in my opinion, is its flexibility, which lets the user select the best programming language for their needs. Since the user is already familiar with it, we can work with it easier and they will feel more at ease using their knowledge and skills. 

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
- The similarities between microservices and service oriented architecture is that Multiple apps are able to use and utilize both microservices and service-oriented architecture's services. However,  their communication styles is different because microservices use communication protocols like HTTP/REST, while SOA uses standardized protocols like SOAP or XML-RPC.  

6. Define Web Services.
- From what I understand, web services are what we typically use when we connect with someone online. like when we chat, video call, or make phone calls to one another.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
- The benefits of using web services are cost effective and flexibility, because as I said web services help us to communicate with one another easily unlike before. Second. it's cost effective because there a lot of multiplication that we can use that you dont have to spend money on

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
- There are 6 characteristics of web services which are the web services which are thr XML-Based, Loosely Coupled, Coarse-Grained, Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous,  Ability to be Synchronous or Asynchronous and  Supports Document Exchange. its asynchronous because we we can send a request to the web service and then continues with our other tasks without waitng for their respond and its synchronous because unlike asynchronous we should wait to their respond before we do other task.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
- There are 6 roles in web services architecture, Provider, is the one who create web services, Requestor, is the one who contact a web services, Broker, is the one who provides access to the UDDI, Publish, is the one who informs the broker about the existence of the web services, Find, is when the broker locate the published web services and lastly Bind is when the reqestor bind or invoke the information from broker. 

10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
- SOAP or Simple Object Access Protocol is a universal translatoy that lets different application communication to each other. WSDL or Web Services Description Language is like a guide on what services can do and how can we use it. last, UDDI or Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration is where can we look up what services we need or how can we access it.
